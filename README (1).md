# Welcome to my mini project on Singapore's electricity prices!

![](https://soleeva.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/solar-panels-on-green-grass-with-a-bright-sun-in-the-background.jpg.webp)
My company decided to install solar panels of some of our properties, which will generate electricity in the day. With the electricity generated, we can either:
1. channel the electricity generated to offset the consumption of the buildings
üëç A measure with zero downside risk of incurring losses\
üëé Electricity cannot be stored or channelled to another property\
OR

2. sell the electricity on the Singapore Wholesale Electricity Market at the Uniform Singapore Energy Price (USEP), which fluctuates wildly in half hourly intervals
üëç the potential to generate a sizable side income, especially with today's electricity prices\
üëé possibility of incurring losses after paying for a fixed generation tariff

For option 1, I plotted out the distribution of electricity usage on a half-hourly frequency. We were able to draw insights from the analysis, and put it in the context of the usage of the premise (tenant mix, underlying economic acticity etc.)


For option 2, I did an analysis on the USEP prices in the past 10 years to help visualise the prices trends, troughs and peaks. I also modelled out the income that we would have realised if we had the panels since 2011. 

And of course, I have transformed the data, but the structure of the analysis remains untouched.





## üõ† Tools used in this project
1. Python's os module
2. Pandas library
3. Matplotlib library
4. Seaborn library
5. Plotly Express library
6. scikit-learn Linear Regression library


## Roadmap

- Additional browser support

- Add more integrations
